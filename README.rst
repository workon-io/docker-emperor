Docker Emperor is a CLI Tool for orchestrate multi-container Docker applications with a Docker Compose YAML extended file. 
Then, with a few commands, you create and start all the services from your configuration like compose but also deploy and manage those applications in their context (via Docker Machine as possible). 
To learn more about all the features of Docker Emperor, see [the list of features](/docker/docker-emperor/overview/#features).

Docker Emperor is designed to

- Describe **all your project** and those functionnal environments in **one smallest YML file**.

- Manage and deploy in **one or few command** (de build, de launch, de deploy).

- Work as **Never bash to remote** local CLI (with the Docker Machine little help).

- Write **custom commands** very easly in the description file.

- Has full **combinatory / heritage capabilities** (environment, commands, services, volumes, etc..). 

- Compatible with any docker-compose existing files.

- Lightweight and dependency-less.
